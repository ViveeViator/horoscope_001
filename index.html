            One of the first steps is to just figure out what lunar phase you
            were born in essentially right and how we how to do how do we do
            that or if somebody doesn't have any idea um how do you establish
            that yeah so basically you're gonna check your birth chart and
            you're gonna gauge the proximity between the sun and the moon in the
            chart so if the if you're born on a where the sun and the moon is
            conjunct then you're born on a new moon if you're born with the sun
            and moon in opposition you're born on a full moon um and yeah if
            you're born with the moon opening uh 60 degrees away from um the sun
            then you're born on a crescent moon phase and so forth okay so
            basically what you want to do step one is just to look at the aspect
            or what kind of aspect roughly generally speaking the moon has in
            relationship to the sun and then once you figure out what aspect it
            has roughly speaking or you see what the next clearest closest
            aspect is that the moon has to the sun and that'll roughly tell you
            what lunar phase you were born in exactly so you start with the new
            moon which is around the conjunction so if you were especially after
            the moon conjoins the sun and once it starts the moon starts
            separating the from the sun if you're born with conjunction with the
            moon with the sun separating from the sun then you were born in a
            new moon phase and um so opposite to that is the full moon phase
            which is when the moon is in opposition to the sun so if your moon
            was anywhere in opposition to the sun then you're pretty closely
            born approximately near a full moon or in a full moon phase um
            actually why don't we can you think of any examples of like the full
            moon we have a full moon we're recording this weirdly and just
            incidentally like we didn't actually, plan this out but today is a
            full moon in Aquarius right yeah yep exactly happening now okay let
            me share the chart for this moment so this is the chart for right
            now we started recording this with late libra rising we just barely
            caught our election due to my lateness today but we can see here
            that the moon is at 14 degrees of Aquarius and it's applying to an
            opposition with the sun at 19 degrees of Leo so I'll animate the
            chart and I'll move it forward a few several hours and we can see
            that later tonight that the moon will exactly get to 19 degrees of
            Aquarius which is exactly in opposition to the sun and that is a
            full moon when the moon is basically on the opposite side of the
            zodiac from the sun and by contrast if we back it up you know about
            two weeks earlier we see that new moon in Leo in late July and
            that's when the sun and the moon are exactly conjoining each other
            in the chart exactly yeah the biggest thing I think with the
            lunation cycle is how visual it is because that's one of the that's
            basically like all planets have phases phrasal relationships with
            one another but the moon is really special because it's so visual
            and we it's all about light and visibility so for example on the new
            moon it's it's it's a dark moon it's aligned with the sun we
            actually can't see it it's obscured by the sun so that experience of
            darkness it's it reflects on like a more internal level um if you
            pay attention to your energy levels around the new and the full
            moons I don't know about you but I usually feel more tired around
            the new moon and the old moon I just want to be more restful if you
            want to plan a party do it on the full moon because that is a higher
            energy vibe and um and it's and it's so visual it's so just primally
            engraved in our human consciousness I feel um that the full moon
            tends to bring out um it tends to bring it tends to bring out our
            wild side a little bit even like if if you've ever worked in a
            hospital or have yeah I mean police officers and nurses they will
            all tell you that their job gets a lot busier around the full moon
            because it brings us out it's more of an external.
